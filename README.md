# Build Repository for [B2EMO RC Toy][thangs_upstream] by [Boxandloop][boxandloop]

This repository contains my notes and any modifications made while building Boxandloop's B2EMO RC Toy.

Status:
- waiting on electronics/hardware parts to arrive
- slicer layout prepped, will start printing soon
- started reviewing and modifying the provided arduino code,
  while learning about arduino for the first time

NOTE: unclear what the license is for the upstream project, so:
- not adding STL files to this repository (yet?)
- nor adding my 3mf slicer file (yet?)
